    Design/implementation/integration notes:

    1. To use this class with SWIG, `%include "std_string.i"`. We cannot avoid
       using `std::string`, because we need to express the concept that the
       caller takes ownership of the value returned by wait_for_next_event().

    2. Move semantic is not wrapped by SWIG. We replace it with passing a
       constant reference for the settings of the Task.

    3. Parsing of the stringified JSON can throw. We have therefore created a
       specific method for initializing, given that throwing in general is
       something that makes life more complicate for bindings. (We may still
       fail and abort() in case of bad error conditions, but a parse error
       is clearly an avoidable error.)

    4. This class is implemented in terms of the FFI API by design choice, so
       in specific cases MK can export just the ANSI-C API.

    Example minimal SWIG interface file:

    ```
    %module measurement_kit
    %include "std_string.i"
    %{
    #include <measurement_kit/swig.hpp>
    %}
    %include <measurement_kit/swig.hpp>
    ```

class InitializeExResult {
  public:
    /// reason is the error that occurred.
    std::string reason;
    /// result tells you whether the call succeeded.
    bool result = false;
};
