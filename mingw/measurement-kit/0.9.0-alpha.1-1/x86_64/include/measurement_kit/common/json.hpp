/// json_process() will basically invoke the specified function and trap all
/// the possible exceptions caused by JSON processing, returning them as
/// errors. Additionally it will also trap all other Error or generic
/// exception triggered in the process and return them.
///
/// This function is meant to allow processing JSON in asynchronous context
/// knowing that no exception will be throw and that it is possible to report
/// the result of processing the JSON asynchronously to a callback.
///
/// \return NoError if parsing and processing were okay.
///
/// \return JsonParseError if it cannot parse the JSON.
///
/// \return JsonKeyError if the requested key is missing.
///
/// \return JsonDomainError if the JSON is of a specified type (e.g.
/// `null`) and you are treating it as another type (e.g. `array`).
///
/// \return any Error (or derived class) that you may throw.
///
/// \return JsonProcessingError if any non-Error exception is thrown.
