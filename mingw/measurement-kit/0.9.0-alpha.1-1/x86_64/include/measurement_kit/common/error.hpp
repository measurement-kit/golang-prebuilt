/// \brief `Error` represents an error that occurred. It is a derived class of
/// `std::exception` such that one can throw `Errors` and more generally catch
/// all `std::exception`. (In general in measurement-kit we would rather pass
/// error to callbacks than throw, but there are also some cases where throwing
/// makes sense.)
///
/// An error is uniquely identified by the error code that it wraps. By
/// popular convention, the `0` error code indicates no error.
///
/// In addition to the error code, there is also a reason string that
/// indicates the error that occurred in a more human friendly way. The
/// reason strings are compatible with the failure strings [specified
/// by
/// OONI](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/blob/master/data-formats/df-000-base.md#error-strings).
///
/// Error codes may change from one version of measurement-kit to the
/// following one. Reason strings instead should not change unless that
/// is required to track OONI's specification.
///
/// The reason string corresponding to no error is an empty string.
///
/// If there is no reason string corresponding to a specific error code, the
/// default reason string `unknown_error ${code}` is generated.
///
/// An error can contain child errors. This is handy when representing the
/// result of a parallel operation where only certain sub-operations may fail.
///
/// As of measurement-kit v0.8.0, too many errors are defined. We will try
/// to cut down the total number of errors to around 50.
///
/// Error appeared in measurement-kit v0.1.0. `MK_DEFINE_ERR` was added
/// in measurement-kit v0.2.0. Between v0.2.0 and v0.7.0 (excluded) we
/// also had the `ErrorContext` class. The Error has been further reworked
/// as part of measurement-kit v0.8.0 as part of a refactoring of common.
